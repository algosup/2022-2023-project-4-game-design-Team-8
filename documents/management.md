- # 👨‍💼Management Summary
- ## Summary
- ### Tools
- The game design teacher suggested we use ClickUp for this project as it is an industry standard tool. This was a nice discovery since it is a great attempt at bootstrapping most of the essential tools for project management and tracking, while also featuring a "google drive". It made tracking and versioning extremely easy and allowed us to draw dependency trees with very low level, bite-sized tasks which allowed to identify bottlenecks easily.
- This took away the necessity of defining all the KPIs for monitoring, as ClickUp allowed for extreme monitoring fine tuning.
- Here is an example of one of the dozen of Dashboards that are automatically generated by it:
![Dashboard Example](/documents/Images/dashboard.png) 
- > This one, combined with the "Current Activity" Tab, allows to see who has too much load on their shoulders and who hasn't.
- We decided to hold both **daily and weekly meetings**, to discuss unmentionned topics, priorities progress and anything else. It was a great way to create a better communication and understanding of the project.
- At the end of each day, I would proceed to write the **synthesis of what happened during the day**, and compare it to the objectives, then drew conclusions and prepared notes for the following day's meeting.
- At the end of the week — usually during the weekend — I would proceed to write the **synthesis of the whole week**, to prepare the following weekly meeting, where we would set priorities etc.
- You can find the content of those daily/weekly meetings below, in [Daily Tracking](#daily-tracking)

- ### 1/7 Week Synthesis
	- Metrics to monitor:
	- Utilization rates to find out how effective we are at distributing tasks and not remaining idle
	- Employee satisfaction score
	- No net promoter score or anything cost related
	- No metrics about customer satisfaction than oral feedback during the presentation and grades on [skills.algosup.com](http://skills.algosup.com)
	- During the First Week, we voluntarily abstracted from our roles to brainstorm on the game's narrative and the way to proceed.
	- By the end of week 1, Mathieu, our software engineer, started working on the prototype, with placeholder assets of his choice while the rest of the team works on defining the game content, mechanics and eventually assets.
	- The sound design is secondary as of now.
	- The team is very chatty but seems enthousiastic about undertaking the creation of a video game. We chose a game genre known by 3/5th of our team, leaving me and another member with some "research" to do to catch up with the others.
	- It seems that the group has good internal communication and that we are all more or less on the same page as to what we want to do.
	- I think that this week, we will all get closer to our original roles as we all learn more about how a video game is made and that we will make good/sufficient progress on the game's content before starting to develop the actual game slice.
	- It is hard to talk about KPIs for now as we haven't enumerated a somewhat extensive list of all the tasks just yet but it should be done by the end of this week.
	- As of now, I feel like Arthur, our quality assurance engineer should start playtesting the game at least once a day, or at least at each minor update by Mathieu and work hand in hand with him.
	- Up to now we all have simultaneously contributed to the game's mechanics, planned levels and content, with Leo and I showing an inclination towards assets (low level), while David and Arthur seem to prefer game mechanics (high level) instead. This seems to comply with the originally attributed roles.
	- Asked the teacher feedback on our progress & organization: he said that it was very well organized and that the goals set for the prototype and content creation were realistic. However, he expressed his concerns regarding the amount of content we planned to implement (characters, items) and thinks that once we actually test the game, we will forcibly cut down on content. That seems likely. Anyway our documents are not read only and are bound to evolve over time, so what needs to be changed will be changed, as long as communication and unbiased thinking remain.
	- Awaiting feedback on the One pager Document
	- In terms of progress we are perfectly on time for now.
- ### 2/7 Week Meeting
	- > The One Sheet gets across much of the core of the suggested game, and is well written and visually pleasing. I would have preferred it if you had also described how the puzzle rooms will work, and had provided a few more USPs. Actually following a brief exactly (for example regarding the number of USP bullets), and respecting its specifications (even in its details) can be important.   An overall job well done, however, but make certain you cut down on content during production. You will not be able to implement different characters, several cut-scenes, and varied gameplay modes in 4 weeks.

- ### 2/7 Week Synthesis
- | DAY | Discuss this topic... | What went on today ?  |
  |---|---|---|
  | DAY&nbsp;1 | The Game has been validated by the teacher and we can carry on with validated content. | We carried on with the tasks prematurely started last Friday.<br>Creating Content (items and levels for David and Arthur) Functional Documents and Character Sprites for Leo, Prototype for Mathieu, and project management and visual branding assets for me. |
  | DAY&nbsp;2 | We need to pause and re do a brainstorm on level design together<br>Check how sprites are implemented by Mathieu to assist Leo.<br>Check Progress on items and update tasks.<br>Ask how the documents should be structure relative to each role => Stick to what Franck said. | Leo advanced on the functional, and got help from Fabien. Fabien basically told us to do a BEAT chart.<br>We brainstormed the animation and sprites as well as game mechanics such as the actual aiming systems, their controls etc, which in turn greatly impact the gameplay.<br><br>David finished weapons, no peer review yet.<br><br>We have started developing the themes a little more in a brainstorm, only got through half of the stories and their respective mobs, more or less 30% of the work done<br><br>I personally started imagining different visual communication assets in anticipation of game publication on platforms and/or its promotion. I would like to do some level design (rooms) tomorrow so that Leo can focus on character assets and we don't mix our (supposedly) different design styles for same type of assets.<br><br>Arthur also started researching and imagining procedural generation specifications. |
  | DAY&nbsp;3 | N/A | N/A |
  | DAY&nbsp;4 | Aiming and movement/camera systems/decisions are probably not precise enough for Leo to truly progress with the main character sprites. We should probably finish our discussion about that so that Leo can get on with his undertaking. It should be first, since it is quick, important & urgent.<br>We should take an hour to finish the levels, to move on to something else and begin Actual Level Design.<br>Peer review needed for David's work<br>Check on Mathieu's progress and accessibility of program. Arthur should start testing if there is enough to test, otherwise he can advance on Procedural Generation Research.<br>Ask Mathieu if he needs help implementing basic functions to the game.<br>There is going to be a playtest tomorrow, See with Arthur how to prepare that | Mathieu made some good progress for the playtest tomorrow. Our mandatory requirements are 90% met as of the end of today's session.<br><br>Arthur, David and finished defining the levels, with additional depth in terms of enemies and game hazards.<br><br>Mathieu has briefly reviewed David's work, and states that no more can be done without prior gameplay mechanics definition. This will most likely come next week.<br><br>We identified that "Trinkets" could be a good addition to our game. Might be a good fit for David as well later on.<br><br>Leo seems to be blocked on the functional and I did not check his progress on the sprites, even though they are not a priority. |
  | DAY&nbsp;5 | Update Leo's Progress on the sprites and define new deadline<br>Check on people's Progress<br>Do a game lens run if relevant => (irrelevant) maybe plan for end of next week<br>Do a report on Isaac => later<br>Tell What is expected to happen next week => do at the end<br>Show KPI's if there are any relevant<br>Debrief on the morning's playtest.<br>See how we could set up a branch of the game for testing assets.<br>Ask Leo to host the sprites somewhere accessible to start designing the maps.<br>Ask Mathieu how level will have to be designed since I don't understand how a 2D map will fit in that. | We should actually have more playtests in the future..<br><br>During the playtest, we found some bugs, and the teacher gave us the idea of using the projectiles bouncing on the walls as a sort of puzzle. => Develop that idea..<br><br>Leo's Functional 50% done<br><br>The scene will be changed to 2D after a vote. It should be done by Monday 10:45<br><br>David is working on the trinkets. |
	- Week synthesis
		- During this second week of work, we set out to develop the game content/mechanics as much as we could. Figuring out how a game's content is defined definitely took more time than expected, but I can't say we are blocked, as people communicate and bottlenecks are resolved.
		- I noticed we are usually being too optimistic on the time required to complete tasks. Half of our tasks this week actually took 2 extra days than planned to be completed. I will take this info to make better estimations next week. Overall, we are 20% late on our estimations.
		- We finally settled on a 2D (fake depth) top down view, which should definitely speed up assets and game mechanics development.
		- Mathieu delivered the prototype with 90% completion which is pretty satisfying.
		- I did not finish producing the game's visual identity as the school's computer is very small and it's screen, unfit for design.
		- The production of the documents seem to be slowing people down on the creation of the assets, we should probably re-prioritize them to put the development of the vertical slice first.
		- The playtest went well, we found some moderate bugs, and even some interesting feature ideas. (Balls bouncing on walls, which may be used as a puzzle mechanic)
		- If we are well focused, we should be done with content definition (items, weapons, trinkets) by the end of this week.
		- We need to define a greybox level produced by Mathieu to start testing the production of game assets (characters, enemies, backgrounds, levels etc.)
		- As for Arthur, while he has advanced with research on procedural generation, I need to find more ways to break down tasks for him before he gets bored with his current task.
		- I believe that more effort needs to be spent on focusing this week and that this could be achieved with more clarity with the next steps, by involving people even more, rather than more "micro management".

- ### 3/7 Week Synthesis
- | DAY | Discuss this topic... | What went on today ?  |
  |---|---|---|
  | DAY&nbsp;1 | New priorities (see week 2 synthesis)<br>Expectations for this week | We set off to produce a minimal amount of assets for the game to estimate time and plan cutting down on content by the end of the week.<br>David has finished trinkets, pending review.<br>2 members were ill so progress was slowed down.<br>I made progress on the game's visuals, it will definitely be done before the end of tomorrow's period. Once I'm done with that, I will focus on creating a branch of the game that will allow us to test the visual assets separately from the main game logic, to speed up assets development. Might ask Arthur to do it if I need to focus on level design.<br>My new priority will now be level design. (since the BEAT chart is almost done)<br>Leo worked on sprites, agreed to delay Functional Specs until game more defined.<br>Figured out Leo should be working on the procedural generation and puzzles, since he is the most fit for the job. At some point either Arthur, David, or I will probably have to relieve him from some design load.<br>Mathieu is still working on porting the working prototype to a 2D environment. |
  | DAY&nbsp;2 | 4) Review Trinkets (and update the beat chart if necessary)<br>3) Check on Arthur, maybe try to have him on item design?<br>How is the 2D port going?<br>1) We need to define the game economy a little bit (and update the beat chart).<br>2) We need to define the lootable objects we will be able find in the environment (and update the beat chart). | I started working on Level 1_2<br>We identified basic room requirements, such as size, items, room access and generation.<br>David starting working on the actual game stats.<br>Mathieu should be done with the 2D port should be done by Thursday.<br>Only minor progress on other tasks, focus wasn't great. |
  | DAY&nbsp;3 | Ask for progress on 2D port<br>Ask for progress on level 1_1 | 2D port: no more bugs for shots, damage works, bullet sprites work well. Will create virtual class for weapons.<br>Leo 
  his functional and is working on it.<br>David is ill and at home.<br>Arthur developed monitoring capabilities on the bug database. |
  | DAY&nbsp;4 | Do the usual check up. | Arthur designed a lot of items.<br>Leo worked on his functional |
  | DAY&nbsp;5 | Do the usual check up. | We didn't plan what needed to be done for the vertical slice yet.<br>A lot of debugging has been done for the seamless integration of tiled maps into unreal engine. Unreal is definitely not made to handle 2D physics. |
	- Week synthesis
		- This week is definitely on the less productive side. Some members were ill and stayed at home, while most people were a bit tired. We didn't progress as much as we wanted in terms of Level Design since we were set back by Unreal's tendency to complicate 2D environments.
		- Nonetheless, Mathieu has made good progress on the evolving prototype, and we can say that enough has been done in terms of content creation to move on to planning, design and production. I will most likely work an hour and a half minimum per day this week to ensure we can deliver a full-fledged vertical slice.
		- I also didn't enforce the proof reading that was supposed to be done, I will catch up on that during my free time.
		- Next week will have to start with the definition of the vertical slice that will be presented on Friday.

- ### 4/7 Week Synthesis
- | DAY | Discuss this topic... | What went on today ?  |
  |---|---|---|
  | DAY&nbsp;1 | This week needs to be more focused, the rewards would be great, once we have a vertical slice, we are left with two weeks to implement the rest, which should be easier once a solid slice has been made.<br>The vertical slice must not be hacky, it needs to be a solid foundation for the rest of the game. It is better to have it unfinished rather than unreliable.<br>Defining the vertical slice is #1 priority | David working on trinkets<br>Arthur on item srpites<br>Leo on maps and characters<br>Mathieu implementing death mechanics.<br>Me working on integrating maps with collisions<br>Vertical Slice was defined |
  | DAY&nbsp;2 | Not much to say here... | More advancements on procedural generation.<br>More room, item and character Design.<br>Arthur started thorough testing. |
  | DAY&nbsp;3 | N/A | N/A |
  | DAY&nbsp;4 | Talk about the Demo<br>Talk about new priorities | We were surprised as we thought somehow that the Demo was Friday, so we caught up in emergency.<br>Did we reach our objectives in terms of features?<br>Yes we did, although the integration had some "aesthetics" rather than being 100% functional.<br>The Vertical Slice went well, found some bugs, reported in the database.<br>Spent a lot of time estimating, laying out and planning out future work. This was the missing step before prioritizing content, which we will definitely do tomorrow. |
  | DAY&nbsp;5 | We need to define next week's Alpha Release<br>We need to effectively Prioritize the content in the secondary Lists (Production) => We need to cut down on content in a way that we can reactivate some later, basically remove a small percentage of all sections rather than cutting out entire sections of the game altogether. <br>We need to find time to sort out the Functional and Technical Documents situation. => next week mostly done for leo, david starts preparing some for when leo's will be finished.<br>I need to figure out what I need to publish as a manager.<br>Ask the others if they want to do a Game Lens.=> not priority<br>Ask the others what they think about the integration of Puzzles. => Mathieu deems it impossible.<br>Make sure a specific Workflow is defined for Mathieu and Arthur to work together hand in hand. | We defined next week's Alpha Release (or pre-release) by cutting down the most complex features we had left: the amount of mobs and their specific behaviors was drastically reduced, which will allow us to focus on more important things such as level design, game economy, room generation and bug squashing. Our new goals are way more realistic and we might be able to bring back some of the cut features (most notably bosses) if we keep working efficiently).<br>We will also start fiddling with sound design this week. |
	- Week synthesis
		- This week was quite crucial as we discovered important engine behaviours, bugs & cut down content based on estimations, started "mass producing" assets and set up a common workflow for everyone to work with the same tools and with the same practices.
		- The demo was satisfying, with testers/volunteers showing high expectations for the beta release in three weeks, calling it a "banger", for some.
		- Test results and interviews have been recorded by Arthur.
		- The demo showed that a simple top down game with well calibrated player movement and combat mechanics can go a long way towards creating a fun and intensive game.
		- We are currently on a cliffhanger as a major mechanic of our game, detecting tiles and their metadata to trigger specific events, will either prove annoyingly difficult to implement, or pretty easy depending on Mathieu's research results on that topic.
		- David is still finishing up the game stats in a feedback loop with Mathieu.
		- Leo is working on the assets and the Func. specs.

  | DAY&nbsp;3 | N/A | N/A |
  | DAY&nbsp;4 | Simply check people's progress and what they are up to. | Took some time to collect a lot of sprites. Decreased staff. |
  | DAY&nbsp;5 | Level 1 Is pending Review. Prepare meeting with Konstantinos. | Had a meeting with Konstantinos, he cheered everyone up and encouraged us to stick with the plan. Decreased staff too. Mathieu made good progress on his side, and I found technically "acceptable" a solution to the tiles problem. |
	- Week synthesis
		- To conclude, this week was not a very productive one, given half of the group was on sick leave during the whole week. We did get few bugs squashed, assets done, finished a Level and solved a major problem. I couldn't work too much on it because of personal duties, next week will be better!
